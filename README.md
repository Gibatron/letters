# Letters

Letters is a server side Fabric mod that lets you disassemble items down to their base letters then reassemble them back into new items.

Have you ever wanted to disrupt the flow of the entire game, while unbalancing it in unexpected ways?

What do you mean no? Of course you do!

It also overrides the vanilla advancements menu, so yeah- there's that too.

You can download it on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/letters) or from [here](https://github.com/Gibatron/letters/releases)

## Usage
To access the Letters menu you simply press the **L** key or whatever key your advancements menu is bound to.
You can also go to the pause menu and press the **Advancements** button if you prefer that.

Once you've gotten the menu open you'll be able to see your current collection of letters.

Any unwanted items you have you can just throw them right into the Deconstruct menu and off they go being converted into useful letters.
You can then use the Assemble items menu to assemble whatever your heart desires, provided you have the required letters.
